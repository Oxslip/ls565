The usage of hashtags is irksome some days.

I typically avoided putting too much out there on social media platforms. I'm kind of a late adopter to Instagram as a result. But one of my hobbies is very visual and Instagram became a hotbed for content to consume related to the hobby. (It involves painting for clarity sake.) Coming into that aspect of the hobby later, I tried to connect with communities and learn about following specific hashtags, but I quickly got overwhelmed or annoyed at the minor differences in hashtags. Just when I thought #minipainting was good enough because it was the common abbreviation and vernacular within the hobby, I quickly saw posts with additional tags like #miniaturepainting, #minigaming, #miniaturegaming, #tabletop, #tabletopgaming, and more. I realized that I was missing out on similar, worthwhile content because I didn't know the folksonomy or community language that had built up around hashtags and the way to best leverage them for finding content. Somedays I was coming across posts that were more hashtags than actual content.

The content vs hashtag concern is kind of interesting to me due to the methdologies and usage of Twitter. A system intentionally designed to have limited character sets. As far as I'm aware, hashtags count against that character limit. So if you want to use your "best practices" that you developed in another system, you would have trouble in the new ecosystem. It ends up being platofrm specific in a way. However, I've seen reposts of "Twitter Threads" which I kind of interpret as a workaround for the character limit situation. I don't know much about Twitter Thread techniques or usage due to avoidance of the platform; but I find it an interesting use of the system that explicitly goes against original design and intent. People are actively attempting to use the tool for something it was not intended for. Did the usage and development of hashtags cause this deviance?
