Our prompt this week was:
Blog about bookmarking and social tagging for information sharing. How do these information-sharing approaches differ from marketing?

When I think of marketing, I think of techniques and tools that are very explicit and by design. I think of Search Engine Optimization (SEO). I think of campaigns. I think of hype-persons leading a conversation and directing people's attention. I think of group testing to see what the most common associated thought is with a word, color, concept, etc.

I see some similarities with social tagging in these descriptors. Social tagging, our current topic, revolves around group-think and words associated with concepts being viewed or discussed. Social tagging has an element of SEO in it, due to the nature of keywords and how a search engine might dig through those keywords if it knows where to look. I could even see how a grassroots movement could build a campaign to revolutionize or change how the general public sees information or interacts with sources of information.

But I don't typically associate a guiding hand with social tagging. I don't think of specific hype-persons leading a conversation. I certainly don't think of it as a tool to raise money or product awareness unless the practice itself is being corrupted by a marketing team. 

I suppose a person might have more faith and trust in social tagging rather than a marketing campaign because there is a hope that there is no ulterior motive. No attempt to sell something or sway you into a product. But really, that isn't guaranteed in modern information consumption. You are always at risk of being swayed or sold something. Companies and individuals alike attempt to do that. 

I personally never got into social tagging services and actively avoided them for similar reasons. I didn't trust the general public to generate content I would want to follow in that method. I couldn't control the keywords very well. I had a distrust for the free service being provided to act as a social tagging tool. If I wasn't paying for something, then I was the product afterall. When searching for content, I wanted to be very deliberate in my search and not necessarily come across something by happenstance, as one might when browsing tags.

I see the value in social tagging and using a collective to identify information. I see the value in allowing natural language to take over. I also see detractors for those practices based around those benefits. Usually around the concept of control, accuracy, and integrity of information. 

Control, accuracy, and (the illusion of?) integrity is what some of what marketing is all about. So maybe there isn't really a difference between marketing and social tagging afterall?
