Hello World.
This is a blog dedicated to a class assignment for my pursuit of an MLIS via the University of Alabama. The class is focused on social media and how to potentially leverage it in modern library and information science work. 

As such, the topics that will be posted about are generally perscribed by the course and will be addressing questions posed in that arena. 

Once the course is done, this blog will self-destruct. As I'm generally not a blogging type person. Afterall, there are lots of people spewing their opinons on the internet, why would mine matter any more or less?
