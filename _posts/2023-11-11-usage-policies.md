This week we were asked to ponder the importance and role of social media policies for libraries.

Personally, I think these things are very important to have. A list of guidelines, principles, philosophies, and usage terms that are forward facing and available for staff to use to guide social media interactions allows for uniformity of engagement and response. In addition to uniformity of response, I would argue for expediency of a response as well.

In theory only a select few would have access to, or more accurately power over, the social media resources of a library or institution. Perks include message management, better internal communication and coordination of content and responses, and a better grasp on who has been posting what kind of content. Granted however, many social media platforms which allow for multiple “admins” or account controllers now offer tools to internally identify who was the actor given a particular situation, such as comment identification. Nevertheless, knowing who is posting what is important since the social media platform can help act as a digital service point or digital storefront for a traditionally physical service.

Better internal communication comes up with planning of posting and advertising content as well as content remediation and response. If a user begins to violate other terms of usage and the library needs to respond, the internal policy can help identify the proper steps to be taken for remediation. The limited selection of admins means efforts can more easily be coordinated among the team. In addition, there are typically, inevitably, library employees who just do not need to know every detail of the organization and should best focus their time and attention on their own areas of expertise. 

Usage policies can layout terms and conditions, remediation steps, and other conditions. By having these determined ahead of time, response times can be faster, language choice and usage can be more consistent, formatting can be more consistent, methods for public appeal/request can be uniform, and many other little details related to communication are covered. Should an incident occur or a question come up, there is precedent set by the usage policy to help dictate how events should proceed. This reduces mental stress and taxation on the management team and provides a consistent experience for observers or public participants. In addition, it can help prevent perceived favoritism by ensuring that all situations are handled the same way. 

I’m a firm believer that any business, agency, or otherwise professional entity should first develop a set of social media guidelines and usage policies before launching their page. Sure, they might reserve a name or moniker on a platform, but before the first post, policies should be established to handle the most common concerns or eventualities. This prevents confusion and scrabbling after the fact and makes for a smoother experience for the admin team and, hopefully, users.
