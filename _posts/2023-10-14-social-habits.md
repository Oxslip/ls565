Our prompt this week was based around social media use and how our experiences and habits may have changed since beginning this class.

I can't say my habits have changed that much due to the class. I had a couple recent life events that caused me to think a bit critically about social media, and more specifically mobile device, usage and habits. Those events and the rhuminations that came from there have had a fair impact. 

My usage of social media tends to focus on engagement with a particular hobby. Some of the smaller companies only use social media to announce new products, sales, events, and similar. Community groups are built around social media and the oppotunity for dicussion there. A large part of the hobby is based on visuals, which works wonderfully on platforms like Instagram and the like. I do not seek social media for politicial, financial, global, or other types of news that might be more "serious". There is one platform which I do use for professional engagement reasons and as a source of information, but I view it as a starting point and a way to keep a finger on the overarching industry. Not as an end-all-be-all source to reply upon. I suppose this view is something to keep in mind when I talk about my own social media habits and experiences.

In the past two years or so, I have attempted to make an effort to "be more present" and to "disconnect". I have done this in an attempt to improve both mental and physical health. I found, depending on the situation, I was constantly checking for responses or the little notification dot to see if new content was ready to be consumed. I would find myself getting caught in mental loops of replaying conversations to see if a better flow or response could have been had. I would regularly check for responses from specific individuals so that I could engage and respond to them as quickly as I could; lest I leave someone else waiting on me.

Those all tied into the mental component and the stress such actions generated. There was also the general stress and anxiety of coming across content that would make a person worry or feel they were not living up to potential or experiencing everything they could. Social media for me focuses on my hobbies. Seeing other people engage with the hobby on a level that I was unable to, and enjoying that engagement and activity set, caused me stress and disappointment. I was disheartened in my inability to pursue the hobby in that manner. Social media was my only outlet for that and it was not the one I wanted. 

As for the phsyical aspect, there's the usual content you hear about regarding screen time, lights in dark rooms, how it impacts sleep, brain activity, and the like. I was having troubles with sleep and would find myself using social media as a way to kill time waiting for the insomnia to end. But in reality, the activity that browsing social media triggered in the brain was probably adding to the insomnia.

So I have attempted to break some of those habits. At first I attempted to use things like the built-in tools of the operating system that tell you about usage, automatically disable certain features when the sun sets, or similar. But those had limited effect since I could easily ignore or turn off the function. I ended up relying on physically distaning myself from the device. I didn't need a lock-box or phone-jail as some do. It was enough to place in another room. (Although one reason for the previous phone tethering was due to an older family member, one of the life events alluded to above was the death of that person. Which provided some opportunity for freeing myself from the tether.) 

I am better about my habits. I'm not perfect or where I want to be totally yet. I still find myself using my mobile device more than I probably should be. But I do feel like I'm on the path.

The detriment I think I am feeling as a result of this is a bit of a disconnection with certain current events. I do not feel like I am keeping up with news and events as well as I used to. But at the moment, I do not know if this is because of my habits or if it is because of other influences.
